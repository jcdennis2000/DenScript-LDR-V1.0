# DenScript-LDR-V1.0

The DenScript LDR (Light Dependant Resistor) Module is a variable resistor that adjusts its resistance depending on the amount of light that is hitting its surface. This is housed in a convenient package that allows it to be easily attached to projects, with our DenScript colour coded headers to make wiring far easier! Simply connect the RED pin to positive voltage (VCC), the BLACK pin to negative voltage (GND) and the GREEN pin to an input pin on your micro controller or development board!
